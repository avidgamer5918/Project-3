Steam can be made by using a combustion generator with a boiler on top of it. The combustion generator will produce heat when given a burnable fuel. The boiler with need a supply of water. If you use a water generator from magneticraft as long as it's connected to the boiler it will supply it with water. The steam can be extracted from the boiler by using an iron pipe from magneticraft. In order to have it extract the steam, you need to right the pipe with a magneticraft wrench where the pipe connects to the boiler.  You can also an electric or rf heater to heat up the boiler. Another option for power is windmills or solar panels, which are a bit more expensive.
